CDiso FPSE plugin
=================

This software is distributed "AS IS" and the authors decline all responsability for all damages (hardware, software and economic) derived by the use of this software.


What's this?
------------
This plugin allows you to load in FPSE ISO images of games directly from your hard-disk.
There is no need of any configiration, just select it: when you run FPSE it will pop up a dialog where you can choose the image to load.


Install
-------
Put CDiso.dll in the plugin directory of FPSE.
Select the plugin with the FPSE config tool.


What's new
----------
1.0: first release... it compiles & works (at least on my sistem) :-) 


Known issues
------------
If you move around the "Select iso" dialog it will close and you will have to restart FPSE.


Notes
-----
I'm not an experienced programmer and I don't want to take credit of work that I've not done...
The plugin is _heavily_ based on the sources of CDctrl plugin (I think by LDChen) found on Bero's page (www.geocities.co.jp/Playtown/2004) and on the open source cdriso PSEmu plugin for linux by Linuzappz.
They've done most of the work, I've introduced most of the bugs ;-)


Sources 
-------
I've decided to release the sources of the plugin and you should have found them togheter with the dll and this readme.
The sources are not covered by any license so you can do with them whatever you want, but if you find a bug or implement a new feature it would be very nice if you let me know and if you help me to improve this plugin instead of starting another one... This is the best I can do at the moment and having some feedback would help me to learn programming better!

To compile you'll need the FPSE SDK that can be found at the FPSE site:

Thanks to the FPSE team and to all the PSX emulation scene.
