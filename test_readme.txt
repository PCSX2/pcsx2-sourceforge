To use the testing script you will need either cygwin or the "testtools" package that comes with the needed files.
The blockdumps will have to be placed in a filder called "dumps" inside the pcsx2 folder.
The script will execute pcsx2.exe by default.

In case you want to use the files from your cygwin installation, you can edit the .bat file and change the PATH=
line to set the first part (before the ;... ) to point to your cygwin/bin folder.
