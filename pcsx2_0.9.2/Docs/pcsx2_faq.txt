FAQ Written by: CKemu & shadow
_________________________________________________________

Q: What is PCSX2?

A: PCSX2 is a WIP PS2 (PlayStation 2) emulator, written by
linuzappz, shadow, florin. basara, asadr, goldfinger. PCSX2 is
constantly WIP (work in progress), and is in the early
stages of development (so don't expect much yet ;) ).

Q: Why doesn't XYZ game work?

A: PCSX2 is able to get many games to show 'screens'. Some of the games can reach ingame
and less more can be consider playable. Speed is too slow on many of them so 'viewable' is
a beter way to describe it :)


Q: Why don't these games work?

A: PCSX2 is in the early stages of development. It can run some games (many of them without glitches)
but the speed issue prevent us of making the emu more compatible. 

Q: Where abouts do I find these demos?

A:You can find some demos at http://pcsx2.ngemu.com or
http://ps2dev.livemedia.com.au. There are proberbly more
sites with PS2 homebrew demos.

Q: Does PCSX2 require a 'real' PS2 BIOS.

A: PCSX2 can use a 'real' BIOS, and is preferable to HLE
BIOS as it is more compatible. But HLE does work well 
with many homebrew demos.

Q: Why not use HLE?

A: HLE is a difficult thing to do for a PS2. Game
developers use their own modules for each game. That
would mean we would have to HLE each module. This would
be a massive task, and not a good idea, as emulating
the real BIOS will mean compatibility with all released
games.

Q: Where do I get a BIOS?

A: You can dump the BIOS from your own PS2, DO NOT ask us
or anyone else for a BIOS, the BIOS is copyright of SONY
and is illegal to download, so we won't help you with 
that.

Q: I try to run a game, or the BIOS, but nothing happens!

A: If no BIOS screen shows from attempting to run a
CD/DVD, your BIOS maybe incorrect. Go to
'config>configure', and under the BIOS menu, check that
firstly you haven't got the HLE BIOS selected, if you do
change to a 'real' BIOS. If you have a 'real' BIOS
selected and it still doesn't work, check that NO 
percentage is written next to the BIOS, if it is for 
instance "40%", your BIOS is to small (by 60%), or 
corrupt (by 60%), you may need to redump it. Also if no 
'real' BIOS is listed, check its not compressed 'eg 
*.zip / *.rar' and extract it to the BIOS dir (note 
sub-folders NOT supported, it must be in /BIOS/).

If that is not the case, your BIOS isn't an actual PS2 
BIOS. To ensure that doesn't happen, dump your own ;)

Q: I see lots of glitches with games/demos, why?

A: Incomplete emulation of the GS, Vector Units etc, this
is a WIP emulator, and will have many bugs for some time,
until more is known about the PS2 hardware. Things 
generally improve with each release, so you never know,
it may be fixed in the next release.

Q: How can I help fix these bugs?

A: Report these bugs to us, post at the offical PCSX2 
forums at http://www.ngemu.com. Make a post describing 
the bug/glitch, perhaps with a screenshot showing it, 
and details on your system setup, what plugins your 
using etc.

If you find any other bugs, with regards to the debugger,
plugins, or differences between what you see in the 
emulator and a real PS2, feel free to email us.

Q: How can I help develop for PCSX2?

A: You can find the open-source plugins at 
http://pcsx2.ngemu.com , coding a GS plugin or and SPU2 
plugin would help us greatly. Also if you have any 
technical information on the PS2, please email us, 
anyhelp is greatly appreciated.

Q: Your emulator sucks!! I don't want to use it!

A: Then don't, buy a real PS2. If you don't like it, 
just don't and there is no need to tell us you don't 
like it, the PCSX2 team put alot of hardwork into this 
emulator, and don't care to know.

Q: Can you give me some more 'technical' answers?

A: A technical FAQ would be massive, and take months to 
write. Instead email shadow / linuz with your questions.

Q: When is the next release?

A: The next release will happen when there is something 
to show, internal changes, and technical changes don't 
mean anything to the user, if they don't see something. 
Pestering us will make no difference :P

Q: GSsoft is s..l..o..w!!

A: Then use one of the OpenGL plugins found at our site
http://pcsx2.ngemu.com or the GStaris plugin 
( http://gstaris.ngemu.com ).

Q: The emulator even with GStaris / GSmax is slow! Why?

A: First of all, the PS2 is a powerfull piece of 
hardware, and will require a powerfull machine to achive
NEAR correct speeds,

Given that PCSX2 does not run any 'complex' commercial 
games, it is hard to judge the system requirements that 
will be eventually needed. Plugins and Emulator will get 
faster as new releases are made, but you can improve 
preformance by turning OFF "Enable Console Output" and 
"Enable Interpreter CPU" under 'config>CPU>' in the menu.

Q: Do I need a DVD drive?

A: Yes, if you want to read a DVDrom you will need a DVD
 drive, many PS2 games are written to CDrom, so its not 
essential, unless you have a DVD based game you wish to 
try.

You can also use 'Linuz's CDVD ISO' plugin to run PS2 
games in ISO / BIN format from your HDD. Note only 
NTFS Format drives (eg not FAT32) can store greater than 
4GB in a single file.

Q: I hear no sound!

A: SPU2 Plugins are being worked on by a few coders, but 
as of now the only SPU2 plugin is nullSPU, which outputs 
no sound, If you are a coder, and feel you can help with 
SPU2, please email us.

Q: Where can I get help!!!

A: You can get help from the people over at
http://www.ngemu.com or on IRC. Using an IRC client, log
onto #PCSX2 or #NGEMU (EFnet). You can politly ask for
help there (No BIOS / ROM / ISO requests, or you shall be
banned). If you cannot get help there, email the PCSX2
team.
