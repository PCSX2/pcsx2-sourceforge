
I will try to explain in sorta how HOST is working..
-----------------------------------------------------

Ps2 have the ability to use loader also other than cd-rom.
That is done through special syscall. Of course the file that
you load must support that..

Basically we wrote that for PSMS1.2

As you can see in the psms1.2 zip there is a file called psms-naplink.elf.
Well that is basically created from sjeep (hi sjeep) for be able to 
use psms through your USB naplink to your ps2. (so no need to burn a cd)
Well pcsx2 does exactly that. Emulate Host +client (host is your pc,
client is your ps2).

So how is work?
---------------
Imagine that HOst is your cd-rom .
For psms e.g
place FILES.TXT  + roms in folders that specificate in files.txt and you are
ready..

e.g 

Host
FILES.TXT
-ROMS1
--Alienstorm.sms
--IamLamer.sms 

I think you get the Idea...
For more questions mail me..(shadow@pcsx.net)
