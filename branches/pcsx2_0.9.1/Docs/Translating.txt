 Translating PCSX2
 -----------------

Just some small notes for translators.

PCSX2 translations are based on the gettext library:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext.

The main file to translate is pcsx2.po located at the
'Intl' dir, note that you must place the translated
strings over the msgstr and leave untouched the msgid.

To test the translation use the msgfmt.exe utility to
convert the translated pcsx2.po file to a pcsx2.mo file
with this command: 'msgfmt pcsx2.po -o pcsx2.mo', after translating
the file please send it to us and please ask before
translating it, maybe someone has already started it 
for your language.

If you have any problems contact us and we'll try to 
help you.
