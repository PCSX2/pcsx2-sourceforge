To do for Pcsx2:
 * Fix threads, semas & events (linuzappz, Florin)
 * Deci2: iop debug (since pcsx2 cannot run only one processor) (Florin)
	  tty notifications
 * Continue RunCDVD option for PS1 exes loading.
 * Continue Bios emulation. (linuzappz)
 * Continue Recompiler. (linuzappz, basara)
 * Fix bios execution. (linuzappz)
 * Recheck TLBS.
 * Continue HW stuff. (linuzappz)
 * Fix VU code. (shadow)
 * Check MMI.c.
 * Check FPU code.
 * Implement remaining COP0 opcodes.
 * Deci2:
	-speed up execution with Cpu->ExecuteBlock(); 
	-fix reentrancy problem with threads (if pressed step button to soon,
		you get a false run state: the emu is on pause, but the debugger
		thinks that it is running) (solution: critical zones)
	-add drfp support [i guess this will not be done as it is not really needed]
	-add iop files load&run support (iloadp; not a priority also)
